# Q3 - TDD on Social Media Platform

## How would you apply test driven development within your social media system from in-class activity 1?

\
The part of my social media that I will be doing this scenario on is the permanent posting unit (similar to Instagram's posting system)

My TDD approach for it would be:  
1. Create a test that routes the user to a new page to select image(s) to post
2. Create code to route user to posting page when that icon on the screen is selected
3. Create a test that checks if after a photo is selected, the user can add a comment to it (optional)
4. Create code that checks if the page routes to a comment page after the user selects next
5. Create a test that checks if a photo is moved to the database and is available to the user's followers on their home page
6. Create code that moves the photo over to the database and validates it
7. Create code that validates that it is available on the home pages of all users' followers
